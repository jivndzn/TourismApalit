                  <p class="paragraph-history">
                    The religious procession is a spectacle of faith and
                    devotion, with the image of the Black Nazarene carried on a
                    gilded carroza, bedecked with flowers and lit candles. The
                    streets become a sea of pilgrims, each one seeking a
